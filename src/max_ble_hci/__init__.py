The package `ble_hci` contains the `BleHci` object, which is used as a method
of communication between the test host (PC) and the test controller(s) (PCB).
The HCI is primarily used by the test controllers during board-to-board testing,
but is provided publically due to the wide range of HCI applications and use
cases.

Implementation details
----------------------
The HCI object contained in this package has many of the base HCI functions
already implemented. These include:

    - reset
    - maximize data length
    - send/sink ACL data
    - TX test (basic and vendor-specific)
    - RX test (basic and vendor-specific)
    - end test
    - PHY selection
    - TX power selection
    - BD address selection
    - channel map selection
    - start advertising
    - start scanning
    - initialize connection
    - disconnect
    - register read/write

Should an HCI command that is not currently implemented be needed, the `BleHci`
object also provides a function for sending a raw HCI command.

Classes
-------
- BleHci

Usage
-----
The `BleHci` object contains several initialization parameters which can be
used to define the board UART COM/serial port, define a string identifier
for the HCI, and specificy the HCI logging level. For the purpose of these
examples, it is assumed the COM/serial port string has already been assigned
to the variable `port`.

Create an HCI, basic:

.. code-block:: python

    hci = BleHci(port)

Create an HCI, set ID string to `'DUT'`:

.. code-block:: python

    hci = BleHci(port, id_tag='DUT')

Create an HCI, set log level to `'ERROR'`:

.. code-block:: python

    hci = BleHci(port, log_level='ERROR')
